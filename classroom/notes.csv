"Edited SMART is an acronym that helps clarify and memorize five criteria of a realistic and accessible goal. The SMART goal has to be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound. 

Each aspect helps you concentrate your efforts effectively and increases the possibility of reaching SMART goals for a software developer.

Specific. The difference between a goal and a dream is that the goal is precise. If you say, ‘I want to launch a unicorn startup,` this may never lead to any consequence. But if you are exact and say, `I want to build a safe dating service for local users,` the goal is more a plan than a fairy tale.

Measurable. How will you know that you got there with no criteria for your success? Your goal might be to gain 20 K subscribers per month, to learn ten new foreign words per week, to become a team leader, or any other quantitative or subjective horizon you want to reach. 

Attainable. If the goal is fantastic and doesn’t take into account current circumstances, it’s unlikely that you will ever achieve it. So it’s reasonable to stay pragmatic and close to the ground.    

Relevant. The goal should be meaningful for you and pertinent for people. For example, if you are creating a new web builder, it’s wise to investigate the market and ascertain that the world needs another one.

Timebound. The goal must have a deadline where you judge whether you have coped with it or not. Otherwise, it turns into an ongoing process. ",Python goals 2024
