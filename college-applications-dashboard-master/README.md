# College Applications Dashboard

This is the repository for the College Applications Dashboard web app. The app was made as part of a project of my senior high school's Data Analytics Committee (DAC). The goal of the app is to provide interactive visualizations of Grade 12 students' college application choices.

The app is currently under construction. A link will be provided when it is complete.

# Local Development

Local development instructions are not provided because the data used by the app is private.

# Credits

The app was developed by Miguel Antonio H. Germar. Other members of the DAC participated in designing the survey that collected the data used by the app.
