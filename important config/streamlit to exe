ERROR IN ACTIVATING VENV
Allow Windows PowerShell to Execute Scripts
To fix the error, you need to change the PowerShell execution policy to remotesigned. This will allow you to run scripts that are on your local computer unsigned, and also remote scripts(from the internet) which have been signed.

Type the following command in the PowerShell admin window to change the execution policy:

set-executionpolicy remotesigned
You will be prompted to accept the change, type A(Yes to all), and press ENTER on your keyboard to allow the change.
