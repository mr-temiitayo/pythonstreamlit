#Converting data from one type to another

# types of data

# 1. integer == whole numbers
# 2. string == Anything in quotes
# 3. float == decimal
# 4.boolean == True or False

# Method 1:
score = int('60')#convert the original data before storing in the variable

# Method 2:
score = '60' #keep original state of data
score2 = int(score) #create a new variable to save a diff data type
print(score) #str
print(score2) #int

#int, float, str, bool

#please note, the default data type for input is a STRING

# classwork:


# convert these to float or integer or string using a new variable
#print and all must run and display well
