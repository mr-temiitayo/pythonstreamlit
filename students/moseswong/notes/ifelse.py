#the if else statement is a condition 
# which allows python to make a decision if the condition is True or False

# example 1
# if rain is falling (condition True)
# get an umbrella (decision)

# else (if rain is not falling)
# go without the umbrella


# example 2
# if student is in class (condition True)
#     start teaching

# else (no student in class)
# do not teach yet

# example 3
# if you are hungry (condition True)
# buy food

# else (not hungry)
# dont buy food yet


# Python example
# Moses-
# Ask for the name of a student
# Ask for his score in maths, english, science, and computer  
# get the total score
# Mr. Tee-
# If the student total score is above 300 tell him he passed the exams
# else tell he sorry, he failed
