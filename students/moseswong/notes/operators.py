name = 'Eva' #variable is name and data is "Eva"
print('My name is',name)

english = 90
print('My English score is',english)

maths = 85
print('My Maths score is',maths)

science = 70
print('My Science score is',science)

#next create a new variable to add up your subjects
totalscore = english + maths + science
print("My total score is",totalscore)
