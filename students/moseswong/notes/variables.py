#-------------VARIABLES AND DATA---------

# data is a useful information in python
# moses, 13, Hong Kong, python, boy

print("Moses is 14 years old and lives in Hong Kong")

print('Moses is learning web design')

print('Moses is a boy and he is 13')

# But there is a Problem?
# what if moses is not 13 anymore?
# what if moses does not live in Hong Kong anymore?
# what if moses is learning a new course?

# It is so stressful and unprofessional and unefficient 
# to change all data one after the other
# That is why we need a variable

# variable is used to store or represent data
#data = moses, 13, Hong Kong, python, boy

name = 'Mio'
age = 13
city = 'Hong Kong'
code = 'Python'
gender = 'boy'

print(name)

print(age)

print(city)

print(code)

print(gender)

#--------RULES ON PRINT STATEMENT
#do not put variables in quotes inside a print statement
#use a comma to separate variables from texts or variables from variables
#comma is called a separator, it doesnt show comma on the screen but a space

#I want to show: My name is Moses
print("My name is",name) #separate texts and variables with a comma

print('I am',age,"years old") #separate texts and variables with a comma

print("I live in",city) #separate texts and variables with a comma

print("I study",code) #separate texts and variables with a comma

print("I am a",gender) #separate texts and variables with a comma

print(name,gender,age,city,code) #separate variables with a comma
